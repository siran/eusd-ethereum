# eUSD: A 1:1 USD Fiat-Stable Crypto Token
## Overview

eUSD is a token that mirrors the value of the US Dollar (USD) at a 1:1 ratio by requiring the burning of a corresponding amount of an existing USD-based token (like USDT) to mint new eUSD tokens.

**Key Features:**
- **1:1 Minting:** For every 1 USDT sent (and burned) via the contract, 1 eUSD is minted.
- **Decentralized:** No central authority controls issuance beyond the immutable smart contract rules.
- **Transparent & Verifiable:** All code is open-source and can be audited publicly on-chain.
- **Extensible:** Easily adapted to different stable tokens or real-world asset-backed tokens in the future.

## How It Works

No Backing

Thereâ€™s no "reserve" managed by a central party. The act of burning USDT ensures that for every eUSD in circulation, 1 USDT was destroyed.

The concept relies on social consensus that eUSD maintains a 1:1 peg to USD via this mechanism.



This means we can trade with the USD without any regulations, boundaries or limits; all through the safety of blockchain.
